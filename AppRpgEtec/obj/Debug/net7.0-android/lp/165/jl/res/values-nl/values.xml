t">Limit the sync app upload speed to a fixed rate</string>
      <string id="UploadBandwidthLimit_help">This setting lets you configure the maximum speed at which the OneDrive sync app (OneDrive.exe) can upload files. This rate is a fixed value in kilobytes per second. The lower the rate, the slower the computer will upload files. The minimum rate that can be set is 1 KB/s and the maximum rate is 100000 KB/s. Any input lower than 50 KB/s will set the limit to 50 KB/s, even if the UI shows the inputted rate.

If you enable this setting, computers will use the maximum upload rate that you specify, and users will not be able to change it in OneDrive settings.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, users can choose to limit the upload rate to a fixed value (in KB/second), or set it to "Adjust automatically" which will use 70% of upload throughput to respond to increases and decreases in throughput.

Instead of using this setting to limit the upload rate, we recommend enabling "Limit the sync app upload rate to a percentage of throughput" to set a limit that adjusts to changing conditions. You should not enable both settings at the same time.</string>
